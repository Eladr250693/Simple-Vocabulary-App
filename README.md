# Simple-Vocabulary-App
Adding English words I come across every day and their translation into a list.

building an app for iPhone that helps learn & remember new words in daily routine.


-The app should the list permanently.
-the list should be sorted by the alphabetic order without consideration of upper/lower case
-the list should update in real time and save its state
-A button for adding new words and their translation
-Should be an option to remove a word (by pressing it or simply deleting it like in notes)
-Toggle button that shows/disappears the translation but every first time the app is launched the words are shown without the translations.
-Freehand in app visibility
